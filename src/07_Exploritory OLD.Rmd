```{r child = 'src/00_loader.Rmd', Include = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
```


The first thing we should do with the datasets is to load them into r using  the following code.

```{r Load, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
#Get a summary view of the data
summary(athletes)
summary(events)

athletes %>% str() %>% knitr::kable("pipe")
```
The athletes table is the meta data for the events table. There is a lot of missing data in the events table for height and weight of the athletes. NOC, sex, and  year are categorical variables and have been coded as characters or numerical. These will need to be re coded into factors. 
```{r countryfiles, include = TRUE}
summary(countryDefdd)
summary(countryDef)
```
CountryDefdd is the meta data for the countryDef file. These columns are NOC, the region that can be used for geospatial maps and the actual country name if the geospace location is unavailable. The countryDef is the data to represent this information.

Before I try to perform some explorations on the data it is imperative that we clean the data up a bit. Factoring the above variables will help with speed to process the data.

```{r cleanup, include = TRUE}
events$Sex <- factor(events$Sex,
                     levels = c("M","F"),
                     labels = c("M","F"))

#years <- distinct(events, Year)
#events$Year <- factor(events$Year,
  #                    levels = years,
  #                    labels = years)
#class(events$Year)
```

From here we can get a breakdown of the number of athletes that compete in each sport since the 2000 Summer games as shown below.

```{r summer, include=TRUE}
Summer <- events %>% filter (Season == "Summer") %>% filter (Year > 2000)
```

```{r summergraph, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 20, include=TRUE}
txtTitle <- paste('Number of athletes per sport, per year, between 2000 ',
        'and 2020 at the summer olympic games')
Summer %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(y = fct_rev(fct_infreq(Sport))), stat="count") +
  labs(title = txtTitle, 
       x = "Number of athletes", y = "Sport") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(family="serif", size = 14)) +  
  facet_wrap(vars(Summer$Year))
```

Similarly we can get a break down of the number of competing athletes at the Winter olympic games since 2000
```{r winter, include=FALSE}
winter <- events %>% filter (Season == "Winter") %>% filter (Year > 2000)
```

```{r wintergraph, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 13, include=TRUE}
txtTitle <- paste('Number of athletes per sport, per year,',
       ' between 2000 and 2020 at the winter olympic games')
winter %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(aes(y = fct_rev(fct_infreq(Sport))), stat="count") +
  labs(title = txtTitle, 
       x = "Number of athletes", y = "Sport") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.text = element_text(family="serif", size = 14)) + 
  facet_wrap(vars(winter$Year))
```

Whilst these plots look cool it is hard to read. It does take up a lot of space on the page, and I am not seeing any major changes to the number of athletes that have been sent in the past four summer or winter olympics. If this data is needed a table would be a better representation of it. Below is the same information for one of the olympics, summer or winter.

```{r summertable, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 20, include=TRUE}
summerCounts <- Summer %>% 
  group_by (Year,Sport) %>%
  count(Sport) %>% 
  arrange(Year, desc(n)) %>%
  pivot_wider(values_from = n, names_from = Sport)

summerCounts <- rotate_df(summerCounts)
print.data.frame (summerCounts)

winterCounts <- winter %>% 
  group_by (Year, Sport) %>%
  count(Sport) %>% 
  arrange(Year, desc(n)) %>%
  pivot_wider(values_from = n, names_from = Sport)

winterCounts <- rotate_df(winterCounts)
print.data.frame (winterCounts)
```
This data set lets you plot the athletes height and weight to see if there is any benifit to selecting athletes of a certain structure. Below is an example using the swimming data in the data set

```{r numericals, fig.width = 15, fig.height = 20, include=TRUE}
  events %>% filter(Sport == "Swimming") %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = Age, y = Weight)) +
  labs(title = 'Olympic swimmers ages and weights') +
  theme_bw()
```

From this we can see that swimmers are optimal when they are under the age of 40 and smaller than 100 kilograms in general, across all the Olympics.

At this stage I still need to find some more research articles that I can replicate to make a story with this data set, There are still many avenues that I can follow up with.
